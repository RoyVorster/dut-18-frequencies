# DUT18 Frequency models

This github includes a somewhat final iteration of the frequency models used during the design process. These models have been made to be easy to use and can be understood quite quickly. 

In the scripts folder, several scripts for plotting, other types of visualization and simple calculations can be found. These aren't ordered correctly but might be useful for some.
