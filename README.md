# DUT18 Frequency models

This github includes a somewhat final iteration of the frequency models used during the design process. These models have been made to be easy to use and can be understood quite quickly I hope. Furthermore, I've attempted to use modelling practices that fit well in DUT; i.e. using scripts in the model, putting things in modules and using version control.

There are a few example scripts for the full car model in ```fcm/examples/```, the principle is the same for all the other models

### Koni
These models were validated. The actual data from Koni (so from the two-post rig as well as the damper rig used for tuning the Ohlins) is on the server. The two Koni scripts above allow you to handle that data.

### Contact

The models were made by Roy Vorster, Thijs Plasmeijer validated them using Koni data and has worked with them extensively, so he's also able to answer questions.
